==3.1.8==
Removed unique link feature and image alt text seo for the time being. These features did not work in previous versions.  The attempt to automatically make images blind friendly has been removed, for the time being. We are working on coming up with the best solutions. In no way is trying to make images blind friendly and helpful for SEO legal compliance with the ADA, if that ever occurs that would be a random unintentional side effect that would be on a site by site basis, based on your dataset, which is completely  outside of our control.
